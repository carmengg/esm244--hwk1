### Introduction

In this report we explore abundance of mountain yellow-legged frogs (*Rana muscosa*), an endangered amphibian species, in lakes in the southern Sierra Nevada. 
Data comes from observations made by the Sierra Lakes Inventory Project. 
We explore 

(1) how observations of mountain yellow-legged frogs has varied by year and life stage (adult, subadult and tadpole)

(2) the top 5 lakes in the southern Sierra Nevada with the highest number of frogs. In this anlysis we only include adult and subadult frogs. Each lake has a unique five digit identifier. 

All analyses are in R version 4.0.2 using RStudio Version 1.3.1093.

**Figure 1.** 
Total number of frogs observed in the southern Sierra Nevada lakes during each year of the study (1995-1997 and 2000-2002) divided by life stage. 
Red (adult), green (subgadult) and blue (tadpole) points indicate the number of frogs observed (n) in a given year of the study.
In Graph 1 each dot corresponds to the number of observed frogs in a given year, the colour 
Graph 2 shows the total number of subadult and adult mountain yellow-legged frog observations (n) in the top 5 lakes with the highest count of observed mountain yellow-legged frogs in these life stages.
