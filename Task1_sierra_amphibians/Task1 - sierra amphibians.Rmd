### Introduction

In this report we explore abundance of mountain yellow-legged frogs (*Rana muscosa*), an endangered amphibian species, in lakes in the southern Sierra Nevada. 
Data comes from observations made by the Sierra Lakes Inventory Project. 
We explore 

(1) how observations of mountain yellow-legged frogs have varied by year and frog's life stage (adult, subadult and tadpole), and 

(2) the top 5 lakes in the southern Sierra Nevada with the highest number of adult and subadult frogs. Each lake has a unique five digit identifier. 

All analyses are in R version 4.0.2 using RStudio Version 1.3.1093.

### Data wrangling
```{r setup, include =FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE)

# ---- LIBRARIES INCLUDED ----
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(readxl) # Read in excel files
library(lubridate) 
library(patchwork)
```


```{r}
# ----- DATA READING  -----
# raw data
amphibians <- read_excel(here("Task1_sierra_amphibians","sierra_amphibians.xlsx")) 

# ---- DATA SELECTION ----
ranas <- amphibians %>% 
  filter(amphibian_species == "RAMU",              # select mountain yellow-legged frog
         amphibian_life_stage != "EggMass") %>%    # exclude EggMass life stage
  mutate(year = year(ymd(survey_date))) %>%        # extract year into column
  relocate(year) %>%                               # relocate year to 1st column for easy reading
  drop_na()                                        # exclude NA values

### Graph of yearly frog observations by life stage

### Graph of top 5 lakes with highest frog observations

  count(lake_id, wt=amphibian_number) %>% 
  slice_max(n, n=5)         # select top 5 lakes with highest count

# --- Update lake IDs
for(i in 1:5){
  top5lakes$lake_id[i] <- paste("Lake ", top5lakes$lake_id[i])
}

# --- Create graph 1
top5graph <- ggplot(data = top5lakes, 
                    aes(x=fct_reorder(lake_id,n),  # organize in descending order

**Figure 1.** 
Graph 1 shows the total number of frogs observed in the southern Sierra Nevada lakes during each year of the study (1995-1997 and 2000-2002) divided by life stage. 
Red (adult), green (subadult) and blue (tadpole) points indicate the number of frogs observed (n) in a given year of the study.
Graph 2 shows the total number of subadult and adult mountain yellow-legged frog observations (n) in the top 5 lakes with the highest count of observed mountain yellow-legged frogs in these life stages.
